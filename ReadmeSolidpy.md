1.Demonstration python program of using 5 solid principles

2.Every class has Single Functionality. The Main function has call of functiionalities that follows OCP Principle. The function walk() in Walker class is redefined in 
  the Human class than follows Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). Every Subclass inherits what the functionality needed from the parent class and this follows 
  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP). Using Third-party abstract method Walk() in Walker() class that takes input and passes it to others hence it follows 
  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
  
3.PyCharm Software IDE is used  to execute the program and the result is which class that can swim or walk.

4.For this Python Program, ABC package used that provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes. In our Program Walker Class is base class.
